# Daily-Work-Planner-App

## Description
 It is a overview about a work day scheduler that provides access to a simple calendar application.
 This simple calendar application allows users to create and manage daily schedules by saving events for each hour of the workday. It provides a visual overview of the day's events and helps users stay organized and efficient.
 Features:
-Displays current day: The current day is prominently displayed at the top of the calendar for easy reference;
-Presents timeblocks: Standard business hours (9 AM to 5 PM) are divided into clear timeblocks for structured event planning;
-Allows event entry: Users can easily add events by clicking on a timeblock and entering text in the provided input field;
-Saves events in local storage: Events are persisted between page refreshes using local storage, ensuring data continuity;
-Color-codes timeblocks: Past, present, and future timeblocks are visually distinguished using color-coding for quick visual comprehension.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application work. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
